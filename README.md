# Hostshare Engineer Candidate Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Tech Stack

- NextJS 13
- Tailwind UI

## Deployment

The project is deployed to Vercel. Merges to the `main` branch will automatically build and deploy a new version of the app.

## Future Improvements

- ðŸ¤” Restructure non-routable files (It's not required, but as the project grows, we could reserve `/app/*` folder just for routing and put components etc in a different location.
